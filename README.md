Project Requirement is to use an open TV shows API http://www.tvmaze.com/api to create an application that allows users to view a few lists(preferable horizontal list) of TV shows based on
different genres (drama, comedy, sports, etc.).Goal is to display a few popular TV shows based on their rating and genre on a dashboard and when the user clicks on a TV show then the details of that TV show should be displayed on another screen.

## Architecture

The app is created using Vue. In addition, I used Quasar as component library and Pinia for store management. Jest is used for unit testing.
